The loan approval dataset is a collection of financial records and associated information used to determine the eligibility of individuals or organizations for obtaining loans from a lending institution.
Steps in a Loan Approval Prediction Machine Learning Project:
* Problem Definition and Data Collection
* Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Import necessary libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Load the dataset: Read the data into a Pandas DataFrame.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Understand data types, distributions, and relationships between variables.
Visualize data
Identify missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
* Data cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
* Feature engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones if necessary.
* Data preprocessing: Encode categorical variables, scale numerical features, and split data into training and testing sets.
* Model Selection and Training
  Train the model on the training set.
Fine-tune hyperparameters using techniques like grid search.
* Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Get Features importances
* Model Deployment (Streamlit)
Create a user interface for inputting loan application data.
Integrate the trained model into the application.
Deploy the application.
